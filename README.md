# algorithm-sorting-in-C
Program takes a hardcoded array of certain numbers and sorts them using a simple bubble sort algorithm that I put into a function. I used a macro instead of a function for the swapping b/c it's easier to read and understand. The program outputs a before and after of the elements of the array to show that it actually did something ;)
